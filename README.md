# genetic_algo
## The jankiest genetic algorithm known to man

### What does this do?

This project is a genetic algorithm that finds the equation that equates to a number you have inputted

There are a few bugs:
* Random div by 0 errors
* Avg fitness is often innacurate
* Quite possibly more that I have not found

Don't plan on these being fixed

## How do I use this?

Simple! Go to line 168 and start editing the variables, it's pretty self explanatory (I have found that numbers < 10000 tend to be what you want to go for)
